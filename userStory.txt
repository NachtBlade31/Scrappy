User wants to automate the process of checking for available slot and if any store the slots in the cart

The booked slots will be available for 15 mins, so once the slots are added into  cart, a message is sent to user in order to notify him of the same

Assumption:
User will manually login We will innto the site to bypass the captcha and user will have a working laptop in place where the script will run


Plan of Action:

We will scrap the website to see if any slot is available, 
if there is a slot we will automate to navigate and book the slot , and send a notification to user
if not we will sleep
we will run the code every 5 mins
